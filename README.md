# Covid-19-Data-Pipeline-
This project implements an ETL data pipeline for COVID-19 case data, orchestrated with Apache Airflow and containerized using Docker. The pipeline ingests raw CSV files, processes them with Apache Spark, stages them in PostgreSQL, and transforms them into a Star Schema Data Warehouse for analytics and reporting with Power BI.
